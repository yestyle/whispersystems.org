  <p>
    In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity,
    Open Whisper Systems Inc. ("Open Whisper Systems") must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file
    that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is
    for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Open Whisper Systems; it does not change
    your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose. If you have not already done so, please
    complete and electronically sign the form below.

    Please read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.

Definitions.
  <p>
“You” (or “Your”) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Open Whisper Systems. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, “control” means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
  </p>
  <p>
“Contribution” shall mean any original work of authorship or invention, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Open Whisper Systems for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Open Whisper Systems (the “Work”). For the purposes of this definition, 
</p>
<p>
“submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Open Whisper Systems or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Open Whisper Systems for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Contribution.”

<li>
Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Open Whisper Systems and to recipients of software distributed by Open Whisper Systems a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works, as well as the right to sublicense and have sublicensed all of the foregoing rights, through multiple tiers of sublicensees, provided that in all cases, Open Whisper Systems will make Your Contributions available under an OSI-approved open source license.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.
</li><li>
You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all.
