Every year when we do this kind of [call for proposals](/blog/winter-of-code), our experience from past events sets our
expectations higher.  Even with really high expectations this time around, we were blown away by the number of high quality
proposals we received for this winter.  It's inspiring to know how many people are thinking seriously about the development
of privacy enhancing technology, and we hope that one day we'll have a space large enough to accept all the proposals
that we wish we could.

The lineup for this January is set to be really great:

XXXXX

lover of things. I will be working on a promotional video for Open Whisper Systems as well as offering my services to the group
should they have any ideas for digital media orientated artistic work. I yoga, surf, hike, climb, read palms and lenormand,
sing, listen, speak, poet, photo and video.

**Yoko Nakano (Yokz)** ([@yknakano](https://twitter.com/yknakano)) I have been working in the field of Human Computer Interaction
for the past eight years as a user researcher, information architect, interaction designer, and a UX designer. I practice and
preach design through empathy, collaboration, iteration and validation. On Winter of Code, I’ll be improving the user experience
of existing iOS and Android apps as well as lending my hand on concepting new work and helping with the website.

<img alt="Gregg Horton" src="/blog/images/gregg-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" />
**Gregg Horton** ([@greggawatt](https://twitter.com/greggawatt)) Gregg Horton is a developer and conceptual information artist
living in Oakland, California. When he’s not writing code you can find him recording narrations of obscure anarchist literature
over ambient music, exploring the intersection of surveillance culture and autonomous expression, or rambling through the
redwood forest with his German Shepherd Husky mix. He will be building a privacy-conscious replacement for the Google Play
store that will utilize his sick Javascript skills.

<img alt="Jessy Irwin" src="/blog/images/jessy-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" />
**Jessy Irwin** ([@jessysaurusrex](https://twitter.com/jessysaurusrex)) Jessy is a marketing communications professional
working in security in San Francisco. She is an outspoken advocate for stronger privacy and security protections in
education, and is currently researching the surveillance taking place in schools across the country. She can be found
regularly ranting on Twitter, and her current passions include dinosaurs, big necklaces, tacos and caffeine. 
<br><br>
During this year’s Winter of Code, Jessy will be using her knowledge of the "dark arts" of marketing, content strategy
and public relations to create content that can be remixed, refactored, patched and reworked to fit the needs of users,
contributors and developers. By working on updating site content and making information easier to find, she hopes to create
a framework that can help the Open Whisper Systems community continue to grow and flourish. Additionally, she will be working
on ways to communicate the importance of security (and the technology behind it) to users who may not understand why
encrypted calls and texts are important— just that they need "something else" or "something secure" to use.

finishing up the interface for TextSecure-Browser and helping out with Signal. Some of his past work can be seen at

that empower open communications.  In the past, I've worked on Blogger, Google News, and Twitter, and I love the role
open whisper systems plays in providing a secure means of communication.  I like building resilient distributed systems,
so I'm hoping to make the mobile signup process more robust by tracking some stats around sms confirmations during signup
and improve sms delivery.  I also love to surf, especially when I don't have to put on a wet suit.<br><br>

iOS side of TextSecure and attempting to live up to a mumbled "yeah, I can almost surf."
