At Open Whisper Systems, we want everyone to have access to advanced secure communication tools that
are as easy and reliable to use as making a normal phone call or sending a normal text message.

Over the past year, we've been working to bring the privacy software we've developed for Android to the iPhone,
and today we're releasing [Signal](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id874139669) -- free, worldwide, encrypted
voice calls for iPhone, and fully compatible with RedPhone for Android.

## High Privacy, Low Friction

Signal uses your existing number, doesn't require a password, and leverages privacy-preserving contact discovery to
immediately display which of your contacts are reachable with Signal.  Under the hood, it uses
[ZRTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6189), a well-tested protocol for secure voice communication.

Signal was designed specifically for mobile devices, using a jitter buffer
[tuned to the characteristics](/blog/client-side-audio-quality) of mobile networks, and using
[push notifications to preserve battery life](/blog/low-latency-switching) while still remaining responsive.
Signal is also [Free and Open Source Software](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS), allowing anyone to audit
the code for correctness or help contribute improvements.  The project even
[pays out a percentage of donated Bitcoin](/blog/bithub) for every merged pull request.

## Secure Calls Are Just The Beginning

Signal will be a unified private voice and text communication platform for iPhone, Android, and the browser.
Later this summer, Signal for iPhone will be expanded to
[support text communication](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure-iOS) compatible with TextSecure for Android.
Shortly after, both TextSecure and RedPhone for Android will be combined into a unified Signal app on Android as well.
Simultaneously, browser extension development is [already under way](https://github.com/whispersystems/TextSecure-Browser).

## The Team

Signal for iPhone is the result of hard work and heavy lifting from our friends at
[Twisted Oak Studios](http://twistedoakstudios.com/), design
from [Tyler Reinhard](https://twitter.com/abolishme), and some last-minute heroics from
[Frederic Jacobs](https://twitter.com/FredericJacobs) and [Christine Corbett](https://twitter.com/corbett).

Signal is free.  [Give it a try](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id874139669)!
